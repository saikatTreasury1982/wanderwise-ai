## Field rules

REFERENCES — these are three different things. Do not conflate them.
- agency_reference: the booking site's own reference. Labelled "Booking number", "Webjet reference", "Booking Reference". Examples: "BAU-10890865", "22522203".
- airline_pnr: the airline's record locator, usually 6 alphanumeric characters. Labelled "PNR", "Airline Reference", "Online check-in number", "Booking Reference" when clearly the carrier's. Examples: "YZQMZG", "DMLQV3", "6K4R88".
- If a document shows both, populate both. If only one exists, decide which it is from the label and leave the other null. Never copy the same value into both.
- checkin_reference goes on the leg, not the booking, when the document ties it to a specific segment.

booking_source: the issuing agency or airline as printed. "Webjet", "Travix", "Trip.com", "Qantas". Null if unclear.

booking_date: ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD) of when the booking was made or the ticket issued. Not the travel date.

DATETIMES — this is the highest-risk field. Get it right.
- Format: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM". Local time at that airport. No timezone offset, no seconds.
- Each leg has its own explicit arrival date in most documents. Use it.
- If an arrival date is NOT printed and you must infer it: when arrival time is earlier than departure time, the arrival is the next day. Add this to uncertain_fields.
- Never assume a leg arrives on its departure date without checking.
- 12-hour times: "12:10 AM" is 00:10, "12:10 PM" is 12:10. Be careful with midnight and noon.

AIRPORTS
- Populate the code only if the document actually prints it. Do not infer or recall codes from airport names — the application resolves those separately.
- Always populate airport_name and city when present, even if a code was also given.
- Terminal only when explicitly stated.

LEGS
- One entry per flight segment. A connection through a hub is two legs, not one.
- leg_order starts at 1 and follows the document's travel sequence.
- A round trip is simply legs whose route returns to the origin. Do not add any grouping or type field.
- stops_count is for an intermediate landing on the SAME flight number. A change of flight number means separate legs, and stops_count is 0 on each.

airline_code: the two-character IATA carrier prefix, derived from the flight number ("MH134" gives "MH"). Null if the flight number is absent.

duration_minutes: convert stated flight time to whole minutes. "8h 30m" gives 510. A straightforward unit conversion of a printed duration is not uncertain — do not flag it. Only flag if you had to compute the duration from departure and arrival times rather than reading it.

baggage_allowance: copy verbatim as printed. Do not normalise, convert units, or restructure. "total weight not exceeding 20 Kg" stays exactly that.

PRICING
- Many e-tickets carry no price at all. Leave all pricing null rather than guessing.
- total_paid is the final amount charged, including agency fees and surcharges.
- base_fare is the airline's fare before agency fees, when itemised separately.
- fare_breakdown: only when the document itemises. Copy labels as printed.
- currency_code: ISO 4217. Infer from an explicit statement like "All prices are in Australian Dollars" (AUD) or an unambiguous symbol. Null if genuinely unclear.

passenger_names: as printed on the document, including any "SURNAME/GIVENNAME" formatting. Used for reference only; the app assigns travellers separately.

## uncertain_fields

List the dotted path of every field you inferred, guessed, or could not read cleanly. Use "booking.total_paid" or "legs[0].arrival_datetime" notation.

Include a path when:
- you derived the value rather than reading it (an inferred next-day arrival, a computed duration)
- the document is ambiguous about which of two labels a value belongs to
- text was unclear, cut off, or contradictory
- you had to choose between plausible interpretations

Do NOT include a path merely because the field is null and absent from the document. Absence is not uncertainty.

Being honest here matters more than appearing confident. A flagged field costs the user a glance; an unflagged wrong field costs them a missed flight.

## document_notes

One short sentence if something about the document is worth the user knowing — it covers only part of a journey, it is a quote rather than a confirmation, times appear provisional. Otherwise null.

If the document is not a flight booking at all, return the shape with empty legs and set document_notes to say so.`;
